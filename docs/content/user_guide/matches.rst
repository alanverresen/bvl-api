Get Information about Matches
=============================

If you want to retrieve information about a team's matches, you should
first determine a team's GUID, and then pass it to the following function:

.. autofunction:: bvlapi.get_matches


It will return a list of matches in chronological order that the team has
played or will play this season.

.. autoclass:: bvlapi.MatchInformation
